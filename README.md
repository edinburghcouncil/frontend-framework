edinburgh.gov.uk frontend framework
========

An accompanying design guide containing details of our grid system, colours, typography, iconography, and pattern library is available at [edinburghcouncil.github.io/frontend-framework](edinburghcouncil.github.io/frontend-framework "GEL").

This framework includes: 
- compiled CSS (for quick prototyping without changing any styles)
- icon font files
- images
- resources (currently the Fontello config.json file to allow adding of new icons to the font files)
- Sass files (for adding/editing styles and recompiling)
- Scripts (our custom scripts files)

This framework does NOT include: 
- FF Meta webfont. This cannot be distributed publicly.
- 3rd party scripts. These have varying licenses.
